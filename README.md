# UE5-Pixel-Perfect
A material post processing effect for Unreal Engine 5 for pixel-based games.

Unreal Engine is primarily designed for developing realistic 3D games, and while its built-in post processing effects and tonemapper work well, they completely destroy any attempt at NPR (non-photorealistic) visuals, with ACES tonemapping in particular being the main culprit, as it tends to distort colours.
